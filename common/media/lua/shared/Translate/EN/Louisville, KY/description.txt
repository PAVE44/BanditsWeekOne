<LEFT> <SIZE:small> Louisville, Kentucky, is a bustling metropolis full of life, commerce, and culture, but not for much longer. In just a week, everything will change. 
The crowded downtown streets, once filled with workers and tourists, will soon be overrun by chaos. Malls, hospitals, and high-rise apartments stand tall, oblivious to their impending ruin. 
For now, people go about their daily lives, unaware that their city will soon become a battleground where survival is the only goal.

Once the outbreak begins, the sheer number of people — soon to be zombies — will make every street a death trap. 
Warehouses and stores may hold supplies, but reaching them will mean pushing through relentless hordes. 
Now-busy highways will become clogged with abandoned cars, cutting off escape routes. 
Even hiding won’t be safe for long—noise travels fast in a packed city, and one wrong move could bring an unstoppable swarm. 
With few open spaces and nowhere to run, Louisville will quickly become a nightmare for anyone left behind.
