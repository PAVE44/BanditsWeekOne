<LEFT> <SIZE:small>
Lake Fallas is a quiet, small city known for its oddly shaped lake, which locals jokingly compare to everything from a bent spoon to a *****. 
Life here moves at a slower pace, with family-owned shops, cozy neighborhoods, and a strong farming community. 
The centerpiece of the town is its massive farmers' market, a bustling hub where locals gather for fresh produce, homemade goods, and gossip. 
But in a week, the chatter will turn to screams, and the marketâ€™s lively stalls will be reduced to wreckage.

Surviving in Lake Fallas may seem easier than in a big city, but the isolation will be its downfall. Supplies will dwindle fast. 
When the worst comes however, the small town, due to its size, will not be a major concern for the government "peacemaking" efforts.
